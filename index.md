## Housing Finders

**The Problem:** UH’s out-of-state students, who are in search of affordable housing outside of dormitories, are faced with several challenges. Students that do not have connections with local residents will struggle to find trustworthy landlords to contact. To lower living costs, most of these students will also need to actively seek suitable roommates while managing other challenges related to moving for college. Additionally, safety is a crucial concern for students that live on their own as they are miles of ocean away from family, especially with the recent rise of criminal activity around the Manoa campus (the most populated campus). While students can live in the dorms, this also introduces several challenges, such as limited availability for each dormitory, a lack of private kitchen and bathroom, and mandatory meal plans that drive up living expenses. Furthermore, many students have also expressed concerns about the condition of the dorms.

**The Solution:** A housing finder website that will help students connect with other students to find roommates, and to also help cultivate a community of trusted landlords that can offer housing for student tenants. This idea would benefit a community of people that need to rent out housing and benefit students that need a place to stay. Safety can be ensured by confirming each person’s identity if their profile is verified and up-to-date, and may also feature a rating system that displays comments from previous tenants. Potentially, different account roles can be included: landlords, guests, users, admin. There is also the potential of sharing geo-location as a feature to show how far users are from prospective renters using React.
